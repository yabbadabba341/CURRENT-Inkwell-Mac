Ingenium — desktop launcher.

This is a thin native-window shell around the Ingenium studio. All of the
app's behaviour lives in the bundled HTML/JavaScript file (ingenium.html);
this script only opens it in a proper desktop window using the system's native
web view. The app still runs entirely offline: nothing is sent anywhere.

Run it with:   python3 ingenium_app.py

# R74: sharing this computer's models with the person's other devices.
#
# The Mac mini (or any computer running this app) can lend its models to the
# person's other devices on the same home network: the MacBook, the Windows
# laptops, the Fire tablet, the iPhones and iPads. They ask through a small
# gateway that speaks the common OpenAI chat format; the gateway checks the
# pairing code, loads the model asked for into this computer's own engine,
# and streams the reply back. Nothing leaves the home network, and nothing is
# shared until the person switches sharing on in Settings.
#
# * The gateway listens on the network only while sharing is on, on port 17860
#   (or the next free one), and answers only requests that carry the pairing
#   code. After eight wrong codes from one address in ten minutes, that
#   address waits ten minutes.
# * One model runs at a time: a request for another model loads that one.
#   The app's own chat notices and loads its model again when it is next used.
# * While sharing is on, the computer is kept from going to sleep by itself
#   (the screen may still turn off), so it stays reachable from another room.
